# attendancebot2_purepython
This is a reworked attendancebot with new functionality:
-divides roster into seniors and non seniors to customize the number of remaining sessions needed to be attended in order to pass
-iterates a csv file and determines attendancerate, and how many of the remaining sessions needed to be attended in order to pass
-emails each student with a detailed update
