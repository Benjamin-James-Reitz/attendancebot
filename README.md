# attendancebot

# this script works and got the job done, but without a paid subscription to the Google API there is a bottleneck on allowed requests per minute from the google sheet of attendance, requiring me to run the program 3-4 times to cover all of the 60+ students in Spring Fitness. It is also clunky because it requires using a google script to email participants. 

# I plan on rewriting this code completely in python3. The new and improved version will be titled attendancebot2.py
