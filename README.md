# attendancebot
This is the pure python version of the attendancebot for Spring Fitness
This bot uses exclusively python code to iterate a csv file of records, calculate attendance rate, and also to tell students how many more sessions they need to attend of the remaining sessions in order to pass

The roster is also divided into two groups (seniors and non-seniors) to correctly calculate the remaining sessions available
